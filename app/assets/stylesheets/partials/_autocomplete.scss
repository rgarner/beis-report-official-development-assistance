// the autocomplete does not set a font, this only effects the autocomplete
// items, so we set it here
li.autocomplete__option {
  @include govuk-font($size: 19);
}

// The styles for the dropdown arrow sets the z-index to -1 that seems to place
// it behind the autocomplete, this may be a bug, but this is a workaround for
// us
.autocomplete__dropdown-arrow-down {
  z-index: 0;
}
